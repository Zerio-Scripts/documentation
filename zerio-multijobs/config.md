# Config

### Adding Icons

Adding icons can be done by changing Config.JobIcons, if an icon doesnt exist for a job it will automatically use Config.DefaultIcon instead!\
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)\
List of all compatible icons: [<mark style="color:purple;">**Click Here!**</mark>](https://fontawesome.com/search?s=solid%2Cbrands%2Cduotone%2Cthin%2Clight%2Cregular)<mark style="color:purple;">****</mark>

More will be added when people tell me about more unclear stuff! \
Everything else in the config should be quite straightforward
