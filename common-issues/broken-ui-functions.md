# Broken UI Functions

Are UI functions like closing the ui etc not working?\
This is most likely because you have renamed the script, if you want to rename the script you also have to change the name of the script in the javascript files.\
This is not recommended although possible.\
**Remember that all event and callback names should stay the same.**
