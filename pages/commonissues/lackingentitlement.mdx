# Lacking entitlement

If you start a resource, and get an error/warning concerning \"lacking entitlement\".

Then one of the following reasons would be the cause:

- You havent restarted your FiveM server after buying the resource. This is when asset ownership is refreshed.
- Your FiveM server's license key isnt owned by the same account that owns the FiveM asset you bought.
  > This is mostly common amongst gameservers. As they generate a license key for you. And in that case, just switch to your own key and it will be solved.
