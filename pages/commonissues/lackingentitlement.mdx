# Lacking Entitlement

The "lacking entitlement" error is one of the most common issues when starting FiveM resources protected by **FiveM Asset Protection (FXAP)**. This comprehensive guide will help you understand why this happens and how to resolve it.

## üö® Understanding the Error

When you see a "lacking entitlement" error, it means the FiveM server cannot verify that you own the asset you're trying to use. This is a security feature designed to protect developers' intellectual property.

### Common Error Messages

You might see variations of these messages:

```
[ERROR] Resource 'zerio-bossmenu' is lacking entitlement
[WARN] Server lacking entitlement to resource zerio-resourcename
[ERROR] Failed to start resource: lacking entitlement
```

<Callout type="info">
  **Asset Protection Purpose**: FXAP ensures that only legitimate purchasers can
  use protected resources, supporting developers and maintaining the FiveM
  ecosystem's integrity.
</Callout>

## üîç Root Causes

### Primary Causes

<Steps>

### License Key Mismatch

**Most Common Issue**: Your server's license key is not owned by the same FiveM account that purchased the asset.

### Server Not Restarted

The entitlement cache needs to be refreshed after purchasing a new asset.

### Incorrect Asset Download

The resource files may not be properly downloaded from the official Keymaster.

### Account Issues

Problems with your FiveM account or Cfx.re account linking.

</Steps>

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions

### Solution 1: Verify License Key Ownership

<Tabs items={["Self-Hosted Server", "Game Server Provider"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **For Self-Hosted Servers:** 1. **Check Your License Key**: - Visit [Cfx.re
    Keymaster](https://portal.cfx.re) - Log in with your FiveM account - Find
    your server's license key in the "Server Keys" section 2. **Verify
    Ownership**: - Ensure the account owning the license key is the same one
    that purchased the asset - Check the "Granted Assets" section to see your
    purchased resources 3. **Update License Key** (if needed): - Generate a new
    license key under your purchasing account - Update your `server.cfg` with
    the new key: ```cfg sv_licenseKey "your-new-license-key-here" ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **For Game Server Providers:** Many hosting providers generate license keys
    under their own accounts. You'll need to use your own key: 1. **Generate
    Your Own License Key**: - Visit [Cfx.re Keymaster](https://portal.cfx.re) -
    Create a new server license key under your account 2. **Contact Your Host**:
    - Ask them to update your server configuration with your personal license
    key - Some hosts have panels where you can change this yourself 3.
    **Alternative Solution**: - Some hosts offer "asset bridging" services -
    Contact support to ask about transferring asset entitlements

### Solution 2: Server Restart

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important**: Simply restarting the resource is not enough. You must restart
  the entire FiveM server process.
</Callout>

**Complete Server Restart Process:**

1. **Stop the Server**:

   ```bash
   # For screen sessions
   screen -r fivem
   # Press Ctrl+C to stop

   # For txAdmin
   # Use the web panel stop button

   # For Windows
   # Close the server window or use task manager
   ```

2. **Wait 30 Seconds**:

   - Allow time for FiveM to properly disconnect from services
   - This ensures entitlement cache is cleared

3. **Start the Server**:

   ```bash
   # Restart using your normal method
   # Screen, txAdmin, or direct execution
   ```

4. **Verify Entitlement**:
   - Check console output during startup
   - Look for successful resource loading messages

### Solution 3: Re-download from Keymaster

Sometimes files become corrupted or outdated:

<Steps>

### Access Keymaster

Visit [portal.cfx.re](https://portal.cfx.re) and log in

### Find Your Asset

Navigate to "Granted Assets" and locate your purchased resource

### Download Fresh Copy

Click the download button to get the latest version

### Replace Files

- **Backup** your current configuration files
- **Delete** the old resource folder completely
- **Extract** the new download
- **Restore** your configuration files

### Test Installation

Start your server and verify the resource loads correctly

</Steps>

### Solution 4: Account Verification

<Tabs
  items={[
    "Check Account Linking",
    "Verify Purchase History",
    "Contact Support"
  ]}
>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Verify Account Connections:** 1. **Check Cfx.re Account**: - Visit [Cfx.re
    Account Settings](https://account.cfx.re) - Verify your account information
    is correct - Check linked social accounts 2. **Steam/Discord Linking**: -
    Ensure Steam/Discord accounts are properly linked - These may affect asset
    entitlements 3. **Email Verification**: - Confirm your email address is
    verified - Check for any account security issues
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Verify Your Purchases:** 1. **Check Purchase History**: - Visit your
    Zerio-Scripts store account - Verify the purchase was completed successfully
    - Check for any payment issues 2. **Keymaster Assets**: - Log into Keymaster
    with the purchasing account - Verify the asset appears in "Granted Assets" -
    Check asset expiration dates (if applicable) 3. **Payment Verification**: -
    Check your payment method for successful charges - Look for any chargebacks
    or payment disputes
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Contact Official Support:** If other solutions don't work: 1. **Gather
    Information**: - Your FiveM account details - Purchase confirmation emails -
    Server license key - Screenshots of error messages 2. **Contact
    Zerio-Scripts**: - Join our [Discord](https://discord.zerio-scripts.com) -
    Create a support ticket - Provide all gathered information 3. **FiveM
    Support** (if needed): - For Keymaster or account issues - Visit [FiveM
