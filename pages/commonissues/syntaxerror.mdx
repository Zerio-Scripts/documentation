# Syntax error near \<\\1\>

If the error \"syntax error near \<\\1\>\" comes up, then that most likely means that there's some kind of issue with the resource files, such as them being corrupted.

This could happen from different tools used to upload files. Such as Filezilla, which is known to have issues with files from FXAP. If you currently use Filezilla, we instead recommend using [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php).

This could also happen, although uncommon, from having outdated server artifacts. If your FiveM server artifacts are so old that they dont have support for the fivem asset system yet. Although, thats not likely as its very old.
