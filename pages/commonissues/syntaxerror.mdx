# Syntax Error Near &lt;\\1&gt;

The "syntax error near &lt;\\1&gt;" error is a common issue that occurs when FiveM's Lua parser encounters corrupted or malformed resource files. This comprehensive guide will help you understand, diagnose, and resolve this error.

## üö® Understanding the Error

When you see this error, it means:
- **File Corruption**: Resource files have been damaged during transfer or storage
- **Encoding Issues**: Text encoding problems affecting Lua parsing
- **Upload Problems**: Issues with how files were transferred to your server
- **Server Artifacts**: Outdated FiveM server components

### Common Error Variations

You might encounter these similar messages:

```
[ERROR] Failed to load script: syntax error near <\1>
[ERROR] Lua script compilation failed: syntax error near <\1>
[ERROR] Resource loading failed with syntax error near <\1>
[ERROR] Invalid Lua syntax near <\1>
```

<Callout type="warning">
**Binary Corruption**: The `<\1>` symbol typically indicates that binary data or corrupted text has been interpreted as Lua code, causing the parser to fail.

md5sum zerio-resource.zip

# Compare with original (if provided)
# Or compare with a working server's files
```

### Check File Permissions
Ensure proper file permissions:

```bash
# Linux/Unix systems
chmod -R 755 zerio-resourcename/
chown -R fivem:fivem zerio-resourcename/
```

### Validate Lua Syntax
Test Lua files individually:

```bash
# Check if Lua files are valid
lua -p script.lua
# Should return no output if syntax is correct
```
