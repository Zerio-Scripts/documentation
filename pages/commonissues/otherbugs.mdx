<Steps>

### Check the Obvious

- Is your server actually running?
- Are there any obvious error messages in console?
- Did you recently change anything that might be related?
- Are other resources working normally?

### Review Recent Changes

- New resource installations
- Configuration modifications
- Server updates or migrations
- Framework changes (QBCore/ESX updates)

### Test Isolation

- Does the issue happen with other resources disabled?
- Can you reproduce it consistently?
- Does it affect all players or just specific ones?
- Is it related to specific actions or random?

### Documentation Review

- Have you checked all relevant documentation sections?
- Are you following the correct installation procedures?
- Is your setup matching the stated requirements?

    "Server Problems",
    "Player-Specific Issues",
    "Performance Problems"
  ]}
>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Resource-Specific Problems:** 1. **Single Resource Testing**: - Disable
    all other resources except essentials - Test if the problem persists -
    Re-enable resources one by one to identify conflicts 2. **Configuration
    Validation**: ```lua -- Check for common config errors Config = Config or {}
    -- Verify required settings exist if not Config.Framework then print("ERROR:
    Framework not configured!") end ``` 3. **Dependency Verification**: - Ensure
    all required resources are installed - Check startup order in server.cfg -
    Verify versions are compatible 4. **Fresh Installation Test**: - Download a
    clean copy from Keymaster - Install in a separate folder - Test with minimal
    configuration
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Server-Wide Issues:** 1. **Server Artifact Issues**: - Check FiveM server
    version - Update to latest recommended artifacts - Review server console for
    system-level errors 2. **Database Problems**: ```sql -- Test database
    connectivity SHOW TABLES; SHOW PROCESSLIST; -- Check for table corruption
    CHECK TABLE your_table_name; ``` 3. **Resource Conflicts**: - Review
    server.cfg for duplicate ensures - Check for port conflicts - Look for
    overlapping functionality 4. **Performance Diagnostics**: ``` # Monitor
    server resources resmon # In-game command # Check memory usage profiler
    record 100 profiler view ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Player-Specific Issues:** 1. **Permission Problems**: - Verify user roles
    and permissions - Test with admin account - Check framework-specific
    permission systems 2. **Client-Side Issues**: - Ask affected players to
    clear FiveM cache - Check for client-side script errors - Test with
    different players 3. **Database User Data**: ```sql -- Check player data
    integrity SELECT * FROM users WHERE identifier = 'player_id'; -- Look for
    corrupted or missing data SELECT COUNT(*) FROM characters WHERE citizenid IS
    NULL; ``` 4. **Network Issues**: - Check player connection stability -
    Verify server-side event handling - Test with players from different
    locations
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Performance-Related Problems:** 1. **Resource Monitor Usage**: ``` # Use
    in-game performance tools resmon # Check specific resource performance
    profiler record 500 profiler view resource_name ``` 2. **Database
    Optimization**: ```sql -- Check for slow queries SHOW PROCESSLIST; --
    Analyze table performance ANALYZE TABLE table_name; ``` 3. **Memory
    Analysis**: - Monitor server RAM usage - Check for memory leaks - Review
    garbage collection patterns 4. **Network Performance**: - Test server
    response times - Monitor bandwidth usage - Check for packet loss issues
