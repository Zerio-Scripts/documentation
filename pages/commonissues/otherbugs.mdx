# Found a different bug?

If you've found a bug that you can\'t seem to solve on your own, then please open a ticket in our [community server](http://docs.zerio-scripts.com) and we will help you out as soon as possible.

We work actively to ensure that there's never any \"known\". But if bugs arent reported, then that becomes a lot harder!
