## Exports

### Server

#### GetInvoices

```lua
local invoices = exports["zerio-invoice"]:GetInvoices(job)
```

This gets a list of all invoices for a specific job. The data is structured the same way as it is in the database.

#### MarkInvoiceAsPaid

```lua
exports["zerio-invoice"]:MarkInvoiceAsPaid(uuid)
```

This marks an invoice as being paid, without removing money from anyone.

#### RemoveInvoice

```lua
exports["zerio-invoice"]:RemoveInvoice(uuid)
```

This deletes an invoice

#### NewInvoice

```lua
exports["zerio-invoice"]:NewInvoice({
    type = "player",
    sendDate = "2023-07-29 01:03:00",
    dueDate = "2023-07-31 01:03:00",
    receiver = "SKZ55766",
    senderJob = "police",
    senderPlayer = "SKZ55766",
    reason = "cool",
    category = "Fine",
    products = {
        {
            price = 10,
            description = "",
            quantity = 10
        }
    }
})
```
