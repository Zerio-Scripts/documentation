# Installation Guide

Installing this resource is as easy as simply dragging and dropping it into your resources folder. Then you'll ofcourse want to execute the sql file.

We do recommend you follow the \"setjob integration\" documented [here](/multijobs/faq#setjob-integration). If not, you'll have to manually add zerio-multijob\'s exports to places where players should get a multijob, such as being hired, etc.
