# Before buying

We always recommend you look through our showcase video and our requirements list before purchasing a resource.

If you're unsure about the requirements, or such, please do contact us and ask!

## So, how/where do I buy it?

All purchases are done online, automatically, via our [webstore](https://store.zerio-scripts.com).

These purchases can be made via a variety of different payment methods.

## Why does my price differ?

Your price always depends on which country you are from/in. More specifically, how much VAT your country takes on purchases. This is **not** something we can control and it is required by law that we pay it on your behalf.
