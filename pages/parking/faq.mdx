## Where can I find the job data?

As noted in the installation guide, you can find information like this in the `SETUP FILES` folder of `zerio-parking`.

## Integration with OX_Inventory

Start out with changing `Config.MenuOpenType` to `"custom"` in `zerio-parking/configs/opentype.lua`.

Then you can use the following item data in `ox_inventory/data/items.lua`.

```lua
['parkingtool'] = {
    label = 'Parking Cite Tool',
    weight = 1000,
    stack = false,
    allowArmed = true,
    consume = 0,
    client = {
        export = 'zerio-parking.Open',
    }
},
```

```lua
['parkingticket'] = {
    label = 'Parking Ticket',
    weight = 1000,
    stack = false,
    allowArmed = true,
    consume = 0,
    client = {
        export = 'zerio-parking.UsedParkingTicket',
    }
},
```
