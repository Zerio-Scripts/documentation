# Installation Guide

If you wish to use `zerio-spawn`, then drag it out of the `zerio-characters`. Place it as a seperate resource.

<Callout>
  You dont **have to** use zerio-spawn, but its included by default.
</Callout>

Then, start both of the resources, make sure the spawn script is being started **after** the multi-characters resource.
