## How do I add new vehicles?

Adding new vehicles can be done via the ingame admin menu (/cardealeradmin), or directly via the database table `zerio_cardealer-vehicles`.

The `cardealer` column refers to the job name (or `customname` value if jobless).

## How do I add new categories?

Categories are defined via the `config.lua` file, and they are unique to the dealership.

## Adding admins

Adding admins (to access /cardealeradmin) is done by adding their primary identifier to the list in the `config.lua` file. In QBCore it would be the rockstar license, in ESX it would be the identifier of the character.
