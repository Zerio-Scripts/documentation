# Updating a resource

Updating a resource is as simple as redownloading the files from [keymaster](https://keymaster.fivem.net).

Or, in other words. Remove your old resource files, and replace them with the new files.

Often, if nothing else is specified, your configuration files can be kept.
Even better, most of the time, we try to post a specific file list of what was changed in our community server.

## How do I know if its outdated?

You will get a warning in your Server Console saying its outdated, keep your eyes open and it should be impossible to miss!
