# Developer Documentation

Information you as a developer, wanting to extend the resource might want to know will be listed here.

Such as notable exports, or such.

If empty, then nothing notable exists at the moment.

## Exports

### Server

#### AddAlert

```lua
exports["zerio-dispatch"]:AddAlert(alertData, menuIndex)
```

This export creates a new alert. The menu index would be the index of the menu in `Shared.Whitelist` of `zerio-dispatch/shared/whitelist.lua`. An example of the alertData can be seen below:

```lua
exports["zerio-dispatch"]:AddAlert({
    blipId = 161,
    position = {0,0,0},
    sound = "adddispatch.mp3",
    description = "There was an carjacking down at Popular Street",
    top = {
        text = "Carjacking",
        code = "10-22"
    },
    fields = {
        {
            text = "Popular street",
            icon = "mdi-earth",
        },
        {
            text = "Adder [ABC 123]",
            icon = "mdi-car",
        },
        {
            text = "Black, White",
            icon = "mdi-palette",
        }
    }
}, 2)
```

<Callout type="info">
  This can also be triggered from the client via an server event, as the
  following: ```lua TriggerServerEvent("zerio-dispatch:server:addAlert",
  menuIndex, alertData) ``` Or via an export as the following: ```lua
  exports["zerio-dispatch"]:AddAlert(menuIndex, alertData) ```
</Callout>

#### GetAlerts

```lua
exports["zerio-dispatch"]:GetAlerts(menuIndex)
```

This returns a list of all current alerts for a menu. The menu index would be the index of the menu in `Shared.Whitelist` in the `zerio-dispatch/shared/whitelist.lua` file
