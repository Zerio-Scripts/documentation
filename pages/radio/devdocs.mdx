# Developer Documentation

Information you as a developer, wanting to extend the resource might want to know will be listed here.

Such as notable exports, or such.

If empty, then nothing notable exists at the moment.

## Export list

### Client

#### HasAccess

```lua
local access = exports["zerio-radio"]:HasAccess(frequency)
```

This export can be used to check whether the local player has access to a specific channel. The only parameter it takes is the frequency number.

It returns a boolean (true/false) to show whether the player had access or not.

#### ChangeChannel

```lua
local changed = exports["zerio-radio"]:ChangeChannel(frequency)
```

This export can be used to change the frequency of the local player. It takes in the frequency number as a parameter.

It returns whether the player could connect, or not. If false is returned, then the player most likely doesnt have access to the channel.

<Callout type="info">
  Disconnecting a player from the radio would be done by setting their radio
  frequency to 0.
</Callout>

### Server

#### DoesChannelExist

```lua
local exists = exports["zerio-radio"]:DoesChannelExist(frequency)
```

This export returns whether a channel exists or not in zerio-radio. It not existing, would more specifically entail that there is no restrictions on it / that it hasnt been registered via the `CreateChannel` export or `zerio-radio/shared/channels.lua` file.

<Callout>
  A channel not existing does **not** mean that players cant connect to it.
  Generally voice scripts allow the player to connect to any valid number.
</Callout>

#### CreateChannel

```lua
local created = exports["zerio-radio"]:CreateChannel(frequency, data)
```

This export can be used to programatically create channels in zerio-radio, just like you would in the `zerio-radio/shared/channels.lua` file.

The `data` parameter would resemble the structure of a channel, explained better in `zerio-radio/shared/channels.lua`

#### RemoveChannel

```lua
local removed = exports["zerio-radio"]:RemoveChannel(frequency)
```

This export would remove a channel from zerio-radio. Or, in other words, make it fully "unlocked" meaning anyone can join it.

#### GiveAccessToChannel

```
local success = exports["zerio-radio"]:GiveAccessToChannel(frequency, value)
```

This export would grant a new value access to a specific channel. Forexample, if you have a channel locked to jobs. This would add a new job to the access list. If you have a channel locked to identifiers, it would add a new identifier.

#### RemoveAccessFromChannel

```lua
local removed = exports["zerio-radio"]:RemoveAccessFromChannel(frequency, value)
```

This export would remove access to a specific value from the channel. Or in other words, forexample removing a specific job's, identifier's or such's access.
