## How to set-up the radio as an item

### "Normal" Inventories

In most inventories, except for ox_inventory and other inventories that store their usage callbacks locally. You'd simply have to go to the `zerio-radio/shared/opentype.lua` file. And change `Shared.OpenType.Value` to `"item"`.

### OX_Inventory

Copy the following item info into `ox_inventory/data/items.lua`

```lua
['radio'] = {
    label = 'Radio',
    weight = 1000,
    stack = false,
    allowArmed = true,
    consume = 0,
    client = {
        export = 'zerio-radio.Open',
        remove = function(total)
            if total < 1 then
                TriggerEvent('zerio-radio:client:removedradio')
            end
        end
    }
},
```

Change `Shared.OpenType.Value` in `zerio-radio/shared/opentype.lua` to `"custom"`.

## Disconnect player on item drop.

<Callout>
  The following does **not** apply to ox_inventory. This is automatically
  handled if you use the snippet above.

<Tabs items={['ESX', 'QBCore']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    Open the `es_extended/server/classes/player.lua` file. Then find the function named `removeInventoryItem`.

    We want to add the following snippet after the line triggering `esx:removeInventoryItem`.

    ```lua
    if tostring(itemName) == "radio" and newCount == 0 then
        TriggerClientEvent("zerio-radio:client:removedradio", self.source)
    end
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
    Open the `qb-inventory/server/functions.lua` file. Then find the function named `RemoveItem`.

    We want to add the following code snippet, before each `return true` of the function. Depending on how new/old your files are, there may be only one, or multiple true returns.

    ```lua
    if tostring(item) == "radio" then
        TriggerClientEvent("zerio-radio:client:removedradio", player.PlayerData.source)
    end
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>
