## How to set-up the radio as an item

<Tabs items={['Normal Inventories', 'OX Inventory']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    In most inventories, except for ox_inventory and other inventories that store their usage callbacks locally. You'd simply have to go to the `zerio-radio/shared/opentype.lua` file. And change `Shared.OpenType.Value` to `"item"`.
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
    1. Copy the following item info into `ox_inventory/data/items.lua`

    ```lua
      ['radio'] = {
          label = 'Radio',
          weight = 1000,
          stack = false,
          allowArmed = true,
          consume = 0,
          client = {
              export = 'zerio-radio.Open',
              remove = function(total)
                  if total < 1 then
                      TriggerEvent('zerio-radio:client:removedradio')
                  end
              end
          }
      },
    ```

    2. Change `Shared.OpenType.Value` in `zerio-radio/shared/opentype.lua` to `"custom"`.

## How to set-up the radio scanner as an item

<Tabs items={['Normal Inventories', 'OX Inventory']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    In most inventories, except for ox_inventory and other inventories that store their usage callbacks locally. You'd simply have to go to the `zerio-radio/shared/scanner.lua` file. And change `Shared.Scanner.OpenType` to `"item"`.
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
    1. Copy the following item info into `ox_inventory/data/items.lua`

          weight = 1000,
          stack = false,
          allowArmed = true,
          consume = 0,
          client = {

## Disconnect player on item drop.

<Callout>
  The following does **not** apply to ox_inventory. This is automatically
  handled if you use the snippet above.
</Callout>

<Tabs items={['ESX', 'QBCore']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    Open the `es_extended/server/classes/player.lua` file. Then find the function named `removeInventoryItem`.

    We want to add the following snippet after the line triggering `esx:removeInventoryItem`.

    ```lua
    if tostring(itemName) == "radio" and newCount == 0 then
        TriggerClientEvent("zerio-radio:client:removedradio", self.source)
    end
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
    Open the `qb-inventory/server/functions.lua` file. Then find the function named `RemoveItem`.

    We want to add the following code snippet, before each `return true` of the function. Depending on how new/old your files are, there may be only one, or multiple true returns.

    ```lua
    if tostring(item) == "radio" then
        TriggerClientEvent("zerio-radio:client:removedradio", Player.PlayerData.source)
    end
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
