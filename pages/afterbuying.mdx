# After buying

After buying a resource, we recommend you look through the documentation for that specific resource.

Most of the time, if not done automatically, you will have to execute the SQL files (if there are any).

You would also, just like any other resource, have to add/start it via your `server.cfg` file.

## Configuring the resource

In all our resources, there are configuration files. Depending on when the resource was made, the file structure may differ.

Generally, your configuration files would be one of these:

- The `config.lua` file in the main project folder
- All files in the `shared` folder in the main project folder
- All files in the `config` folder in the main project folder
