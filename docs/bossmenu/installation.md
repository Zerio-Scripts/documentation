# Installation Guide

Installing this script is as easy as just downloading the script from the following [**website**](https://keymaster.fivem.net/)

After downloading the script you have to put it in your resources folder or a sub folder of the resources folder.

Lastly you will have to execute the SQL file to ensure that the script works with your server.

## OPTIONAL

If you use anything else than esx_society / qb-management you will have to change the server functions.lua file.
