# Introduction

This is a modern Dispatch script with all the features that you would expect/need. It supports an (technically) infinite amount of different jobs/menus so you dont need to worry about having different dispatch scripts for different jobs, this simply supports all of them.

## Features

- Default alerts (Shooting, Fighting Car Jacking, Player Death & Reckless Driving)
- Extensive Config
- Translations for both UI and Lua
- Support with possible issues
- Member List
- Alerts History
- Newest Alerts Box
- Interactive Map
- Quick keybinds
- See jobmembers on the dispatch map

## Requirements

This is a QB-Core / ESX script and for that reason it requires any official version of QB-Core or ESX. It has been tested on most of the newest versions and it supports any SQL script.<br/>
If a specific ESX / QB-Core version doesnt work then you can report it in our discord server and we will fix it as fast as possible!
