# Installation guide

Installing this script is as easy as just downloading the script from the following [**website**](https://keymaster.fivem.net/)<br/>
After downloading the script you have to put it in your resources folder or a sub folder of the resources folder.<br/>
Lastly, you will have to drag "zerio-spawn" out of the "zerio-characters" folder into its own folder.

## Important

Zerio-Characters should be started before Zerio-Spawn and both scripts should be started after main core scripts.

## Optional

You are able to customize the script through locales and the config. If you want to go more indepth there are functions files and javascript files that are fully open sourced waiting for you to change them.
