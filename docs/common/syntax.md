# Syntax Error near <\\1>

If this shows up upon starting one of our scripts this is because your FiveM artifacts / server files are outdated. To fix this issue I would recommend downloading the latest recommended FiveM artifacts<br/>
<br/>
**Why does this happen?** This is because your FiveM artifacts are so old that the CFX whitelist used to validate the owner of this script doesnt exist in your FiveM artifacts.
