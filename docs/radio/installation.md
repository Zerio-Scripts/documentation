# Installation guide

Installing this script is as easy as just downloading the script from the following [**website**](https://keymaster.fivem.net/)<br/>
After downloading the script you have to put it in your resources folder or a sub folder of the resources folder.<br/>

**Optional:** You are able to customize the script through locales and the config. If you want to go more indepth there are functions files and javascript files that are fully open sourced waiting for you to change them.
